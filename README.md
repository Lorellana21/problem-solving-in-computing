# problem-solving-in-computing

Using my detailed understanding of a programming language as versatile as JS, IÂ´m going to apply it to solve problems like the ones you could find in some job interviews.

Through several exercises I will see how to approach this kind of problems in a methodical way.

There is a revision about how basic data structures works (Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Lists, Trees). The goal is to understand some basic algorithms and their application.
Also, how recursive vs. iterative programming works and see an intuitive approach to algorithmic complexity to measure how efficient our solutions are.
